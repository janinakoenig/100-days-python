# 🎯 Day 2 – Palindrome Checker

Welcome to Day 2 of my **100 Days of Python** challenge! 🐍🚀  

Today’s goal was to build a Palindrome Checker

---

## 🕹️ The Game

You will be asked to enter one word.

The program tells you whether it is a palindrome or not

---

## ▶️ How to Run

From inside this folder:

```bash
python main.py

## 💡 What I Learned

- I learned that I need to assign the result of `.lower()` to a variable, because calling `word.lower()` alone does not modify the original string.
